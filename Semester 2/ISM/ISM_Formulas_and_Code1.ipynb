    "- ANOVA is used to test the null hypothesis that the means of $k$ populations are equal.\n",
    "- $k$ is the number of populations, $n$ is the total number of observations, $n_i$ is the number of observations in population $i$, $\\bar{x}_i$ is the sample mean of population $i$, $s_i^2$ is the sample variance of population $i$.\n",
