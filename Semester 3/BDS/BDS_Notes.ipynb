    "| 1. Define the Problem     | Clearly define the problem statement, including the goal and the target variable(s).<br> Identify the available resources, constraints, and relevant stakeholders.<br> Understand the domain knowledge and business context to ensure the problem's relevance. |\n",
    "| 2. Data Collection        | Determine the data requirements based on the problem definition.<br> Identify potential data sources and acquire the necessary datasets.<br> Ensure data quality by performing data validation, cleaning, and handling missing values or outliers. |\n",
    "| 3. Data Exploration       | Perform statistical analysis, such as summary statistics and data distributions.<br> Visualize the data through plots, histograms, scatterplots, or heatmaps.<br> Identify correlations, patterns, and outliers within the dataset.<br> Conduct feature correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables. |\n",
    "| 4. Feature Engineering    | Select relevant features based on domain knowledge and exploration.<br> Handle categorical variables through techniques like one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.<br> Scale numerical features to a common range or apply normalization techniques.<br> Create new features by transforming or combining existing ones (e.g., feature interactions, polynomial features). |\n",
    "| 5. Model Selection        | Identify the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).<br> Consider the characteristics of the dataset (e.g., size, dimensionality) and the assumptions of different algorithms.<br> Evaluate various algorithms and choose the one that best suits the problem and data. |\n",
    "| 6. Model Training         | Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., using random sampling or time-based splitting).<br> Apply the chosen algorithm to the training data and optimize its hyperparameters.<br> Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics.<br> Repeat the training process with different algorithms or parameter settings if necessary. |\n",
    "| 7. Model Evaluation       | Calculate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or mean squared error.<br> Perform cross-validation or holdout validation to estimate the model's performance on unseen data.<br> Analyze the model's strengths, weaknesses, and potential biases.<br> Consider business requirements and domain-specific metrics for a comprehensive evaluation. |\n",
    "| 8. Model Optimization     | Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters through techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.<br> Regularize the model to prevent overfitting using techniques like L1/L2 regularization or dropout.<br> Explore ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, to improve model performance.<br> Use feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant or redundant features. |\n",
    "| 9. Model Deployment       | Prepare the model for deployment by saving its trained parameters and associated preprocessing steps.<br> Integrate the model into an application, system, or cloud infrastructure.<br> Design and implement an API for making predictions using the deployed model.<br> Ensure the model's scalability, robustness, and security in a production environment. |\n",
    "| 10. Monitoring and Maintenance | Continuously monitor the model's performance in real-world scenarios.<br> Collect feedback and track performance metrics to detect any degradation or concept drift.<br> Retrain the model periodically with new data to keep it up-to-date and maintain its accuracy.<br> Conduct regular model audits and updates as needed. |\n",
    "| 11. Iteration and Improvement | Regularly revisit and refine the model as new insights are gained, data quality improves, or new techniques emerge.<br> Incorporate feedback from stakeholders and address any limitations or shortcomings.<br> Continuously experiment with new algorithms or approaches to improve the model's performance and adapt to evolving requirements. |\n",
